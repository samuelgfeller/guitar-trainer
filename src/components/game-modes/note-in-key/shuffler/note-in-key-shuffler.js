Copilot task:

can you help me with creating a shuffling algorythm with a few rules.
Input is an array containing a string corresponding to a guitar string name in position 0 and an
object containing a noteName and fretPosition values like this: [ ['E', {"noteName": "E"," fretPosition": 0}],
['E', {"noteName": "F"," fretPosition": 1}], ['E', {"noteName": "F♯", "fretPosition": 2}], // etc... ]
Another input is previousElement which contains a an array with a string and object with noteName and
noteNumber which should be taken into consideration as if it was the previous element in the shuffled
array so the first element in the shuffled array must respect the conditions with this previous note.
The output is the shuffled array with array elements containing a string name and the noteName
[["E", "F♯"], ["E", "E"], //etc]  The shuffle conditions are the following
1. The index of the array elements from the input array must not be adjacent to the previous element in
the shuffled array. This means that element 1 from the input array must not be next to the element
0 or 2 in the shuffled array. The shuffled order could be 0, 2, 4, 1, 3 for instance but not 0, 1, 2, 3
2. There must not be 2 following elements in the shuffled array with the same noteName.
This is valid: [["E", "F♯"], ["E", "E"], ] this is invalid because the note name is the same [["E", "F♯"], ["A", "F♯"], ]
3. There is a given maxGap and this number represents the maximum allowed gap of the fret position
between 2 consecutive elements in the shuffled array. If the maxGap is 1, the element ['E', {"noteName": "F"," fretPosition": 1}] and must be after a note from any string but with the fretPosition 0, 1 or 2. The element ['A', {"noteName": "D"," fretPosition": 5}] is not permitted but ['A', {"noteName": "B"," fretPosition": 2}] is allowed.
If it is impossible to respect all the rules, the best possible combinations should be made with as
little discrepancies as possible. If the gap 1 is not possible, it could be tried with a higher gap 2,
then 3 etc. The entire thing can be shuffled multiple times as well and the best run taken.
Are my instructions clear or do you have questions? What approach would you take to develop this
algorythm and make the best output possible? Please do it with javascript and dont hesitate to ask
questions if you need to make decisions. This is a collaborative task between you and me.


if the input array is still not empty after 50 attempts, re shuffle the whole thing but keep track of the
score of how well it could be shuffled. do the whole thing 50 more times if it always fails to empty the
input array, take the best run with the least discrepancies where the gap and other conditions could be
respected the best. The gap cannot be increased by more than 2, if its still not possible to find an
element respecting the other conditions, the other two conditions may be ignored for that iteration to find a next element.
