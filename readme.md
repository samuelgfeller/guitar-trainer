# Welcome to the Fretboard Trainer for Guitar!

This game is designed to help improve fretboard skills and enhance the 
ability to locate and play notes on the guitar.  

It provides an interactive way to practice navigating the fretboard and 
playing the correct notes on different strings.

Here's how it works:

1. Visit [guitar.samuel-gfeller.ch](https://guitar.samuel-gfeller.ch).
2. Click on the settings icon in the header to select a game mode.
1. Click on the play icon to start the game or practice session.

## Available Game Modes
### Fretboard Note Game
This game mode is about learning the place of every note on every string on the guitar fretboard. 

A metronome tempo (bpm) can be chosen that will be the frequency in which a string and note will be displayed.

The goal is to play the note that is displayed on the required string before time runs out.

The game will detect when the right note is played and it'll highlight it in green.

When you fail to play a note correctly, the game will store that combination and it will have a higher chance 
of appearing again in order to practice it.

The progress bar represents the number of challenging notes that still need to be "learned" correctly.

Each time a challenging note is played correctly three times, it is removed from the special list and the progress bar advances.

After mastering all challenging notes, 10 additional notes have to be played correctly to fill the progress bar to 100% and complete the level.

There is an option that can be enabled to learn the treble clef simultaneously where the note to play is displayed on a treble clef staff.

### Practice diatonic notes in any key
To improvise and play along songs it is useful to know where to play the diatonic notes on the major or minor scales. 
With this game mode, the steps of the major scale of any key can be practiced.

A random string and key will be generated and displayed.

The note on the given string will be the note number 1 of the key.

The goal is to play the note number diatonic to the key, on the given string.

For example, if the key is C, the note number 4 is F. If the key is G, number 4 is C.

Upon correctly playing the note, a new string and note number will be displayed.

After successfully playing 30 notes, a new key is suggested. The key can also be changed anytime
with the "reload" button.

In the settings icon, you can adjust the difficulty among three levels that affect the
distance between the requested notes and note number 1 on the fretboard.
