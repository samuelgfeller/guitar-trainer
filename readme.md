# Welcome to the Fretboard Practice Game for Guitar!

This game is designed to help improve your fretboard skills and enhance your 
ability to locate and play notes on the guitar.  

It provides a fun and interactive way to practice navigating the fretboard and 
playing the correct notes on different strings.

Here's how it works:

1. Visit [guitar.samuel-gfeller.ch](https://guitar.samuel-gfeller.ch).
1. Set the desired beats per minute (BPM) on the metronome.
1. Click "Play" to start or resume the game.
1. The game will display a random combination of a note and string on the graphical user interface (GUI).
1. Your goal is to play the correct note on the given string before the combination switches to the next one.
1. If you have enabled microphone access, the game will listen for the correct note. When you play the right note on the string, it will be highlighted in green to indicate a correct response.
1. However, if the correct note is not detected by the microphone, don't worry! The game will store that combination and it will have a higher chance of appearing again in order to provide more practice opportunities.
1. The combination will continue to appear until you play it correctly three times in a row. Once you achieve this, the note will be removed from the special list, and it will be fully randomized when it appears again. 


Have fun exploring the guitar's fretboard and becoming more proficient in playing notes accurately.
